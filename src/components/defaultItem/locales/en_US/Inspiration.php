 "I think every­thing in life is art. What you do. How you dress. The way you love some­one, and how you talk. Your smile and your per­son­al­ity. What you believe in, and all your dreams. The way you drink your drinks. How you dec­o­rate your home. Or party. The way you write your gro­cery list. The food you make. How your hand­writ­ing looks. And the way you feel. Life is art."<br>

<p>"People  of different religions and cultures live side by side in almost every  part of the world, and most of us have overlapping identities which  unite us with very different groups. We can love what we are, without  hating what – and who – we are not. We  can thrive in our own tradition, even as we learn from others, and  come to respect their teachings." <br>
 <strong>- Kofi  Annan, Former Secretary-General of the United Nations</strong></p>'
