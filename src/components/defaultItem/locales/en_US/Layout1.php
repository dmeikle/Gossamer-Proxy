    'SECTION1' => 'The influence for the design of this office was the city Shanghai, I had been up to Shanghai a few times and one trip photographed a lot of architectural details that were predominant European but had subtle touches of Chinese elements of design. The feel I was going for was a Shanghai trading company from around the 1920’s-30’s. My starting point was using the Chinese cloud element of design and I incorporated in screens, doors, light fixtures, ceiling corners, and for the custom entrance floor mosaic tile pattern. ',
    'SECTION2' => 'I used the dimensions of a 4 seated cubicle and used two styles of Chinese screen designs for the partitions that have the cloud icon. I designed the post to be capped with simple Tudor detail to finish the ends off. Basically using a new seating unit concept but using older styling.',
    'SECTION3' => 'Main entrance doors were custom made with the screen detail of the cloud icon, this pattern would then be transferred to the floor mosaic pattern.',
    'SECTION4' => 'I sourced a plaster moulding company and chose this detail to tie in with the cloud door corner detail, the detail is subtle but these are the details that make the difference and why people walk in and feel what they feel, it’s the balance and editing in design pulling back and keeping it clean and simple.',
    'SECTION5' => 'Door detail reflected in the floor mosaic pattern.',
    'SECTION6' => 'Partition detail - A close up, the workmanship that goes into these screens are all hand made. The stain colour I chose was to match the Spanish cedar flooring in the reception, we also did all the wood window blinds this colour.',
    'SECTION7' => 'The ceiling fan took a long time to source but it was critical to get the wire cage design and have them painted grey to give it the nostalgic look of the 1920-30’s',
    'SECTION8' => 'The reception desk I built myself as I had time on site managing and was around to answer the trade’s questions on details. The Chinese tradesmen were “wah the Lao wai (friendly term for Old foreigner) really knows how to use tools and build stuff too” I got immediate respect that I was one of them.',
    'SECTION9' => 'Reception area to main office',
    'SECTION10' => 'I had a Chinese antique cabinet custom made with square hardware from its time period. Then I sourced all square fixtures and made the black square mirror frame to suit. The one Chinese element, that of the cabinet and hardware which totally transforms the room to an Asian feel. I love the minimalism of some of the Chinese antique furniture it’s so suited with today’s modern elements.',
    'SECTION11' => 'Now in the Womans restroom, I had the antique replica cabinet made and put a marble slab on top plus chose round Chinese antique hardware to coincide with all the specified round fixtures that sourced to suit.',
    'SECTION12' => 'I added other black Chinese antique furniture to Asian inspired chairs in the reception area. ',
    'SECTION13' => 'These two photos are of the gift  showroom, I also built the cabinets at the back and one shelving unit  then let the guys build the rest. I chose a grey ceiling to coincide  with the concrete floors in a sense to frame the white walls for  display.'
