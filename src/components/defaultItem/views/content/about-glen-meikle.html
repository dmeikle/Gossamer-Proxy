<p> <img style="margin:0px 10px 10px 0px" src="/images/Glen Saw 001.jpg" width="260" height="239" align="left">Ever  since he was a boy, Glen has been comfortable around hand tools;  always wanting to create and this always came naturally. Throughout  school, his participation in sports, metal, woodworking and art  classes proved to be more interesting than academics. Once out of  high school, his Father encouraged him to learn a trade before going  to university. With this guidance and following 2 generations of  family trade footsteps he entered the British Columbia Institute of  Technology and became an electrician.  This experience would set in  motion a path of learning that would influence Glen through his  adulthood. In lieu of a traditional university education, Glen became  a student of the craft, that of an artisan. His desire to see the end  product would lead his curiosity to learn a variety of trades; taking  classes in cabinetry and furniture making as well learning hands on;  plastering, faux painting, upholstering, tiling, all that it takes to  see the final design outlook. This led to a natural progression of  entrepreneurship in which he started his own Design-Build  Construction Company; specializing in homes, offices and restaurants.  In 1999 his work on  a local Art â€“ Cafe Establishment was  recognized by the British Columbia Interior Design Institute of  Vancouver as the Gold Medal Winner in overall design. Throughout  these &lsquo;building years&rsquo; he would design and create his own  furniture and use the leftover material for contemporary art pieces.</p>

<p> In  1995 an invitation for an interior design project brought Glen to  Hong Kong. This was his first visit to Asia which also brought him  into contact with China....the workshop of the world. Glen knew then,  the opportunities to create would be limitless. He returned to Asia  in 2001, in pursuit of an entrepreneurial aspiration. He soon learned  the challenges of opening a factory: designing, sourcing, quality  control and management. In the midst of all of this he realized the  fundamental necessity for success.....qualifying factories with his  sense of purpose and shared values. This in turn allowed him to  broaden his creative process and expand into other categories of  products with a concerted focus on product development. His work  experience and broad range of product development allowed him to  travel to nearly every province in China. Through these travels and  experiences, he became fascinated with the culture and history of  China. The Chinese architecture and artistic elements of Asian design  have become his inspiration as well as the language itself.</p>

<p>Specializing  in the seasonal and gift market, Glen has overseen every aspect of a  product&rsquo;s development which includes designing, sculpting,  painting, sewing, welding and basically anything it takes to bring  these creations to market. His hands-on approach to product design  and development adds a personalized touch to every piece he creates.  With his construction experience back home and an extensive network  of friends in China, he was given the opportunity to design other  commercial premises. It was here that Glen began to seamlessly blend  East and West designs. The influences of the Chinese characteristics  in particular, are a reflection of his love and respect<img align="right" style="margin:10px 0px 10px 10px" src="images/Glen Standing.jpg" width="172" height="259"> for this rich  culture. Roughly 6 years ago, he sculpted his first concept of wall  decor combining his creativity and desire to surround himself with  unique elements of Oriental design. Through his fascination of the  Chinese history, language and culture he would integrate the design  elements collected from his travels to reflect a multitude of Chinese  motifs, designs, and patterns into his wall art. All of these  elements combined, reflect both the beautiful symbolism and  auspicious meanings of the rich Chinese culture.</p>
