                <p>Dr Michael Rekart has almost everything a man could want — a home near UBC, a job on campus he can walk to, enough money, two beautiful grown children, friends around the world and many proud accomplishments. But in early December he boards a plane for Sierra Leone, plunging into the heart of the Ebola crisis on behalf of the international humanitarian aid group Medecins Sans Frontiere (Doctors Without Borders).
    </p>
    <p>Rekart, 67 and semi-retired, is well aware of the risks.
    </p>
    <p>
    “I am worried that I might get infected,” the part-time professor said in an interview in his office at the University of B.C.’s school of population and public health. “I am worried that if I get infected, it’s possible I could have a fatal outcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
    But for him, there is no choice. He must go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tom will interview Dr Mike upon his return and will ask about his faith, his family and the forces that drive him to live a rather dangerous life.</p>
