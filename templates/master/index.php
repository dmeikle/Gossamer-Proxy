		<p>Do you believe in the paranormal? I guess it doesn't really matter, really. Because if ghosts truly exist, they believe in you. Spirits and inhabitants can be present in just about any place - an apartment, a new home, cemeteries, even a place of business. SpectralCow (we just love the name...) is a Paranormal Investigations team based in Vancouver. We look to either validate ('why yes, you have definite spiritual activity here') or debunk ('hey..someone simply left the window open..') suspected paranormal activities in the Vancouver and Fraser Valley district. Are you suspicious of paranormal or spiritual activity in your location? We will investigate and verify for you. Did someone pass away and you want to ensure their resident energy has been dissipated? We can help with the cleansing of your location. Are you simply uncomfortable with the energy of your home and want to clear out all the 'nasties' and invite a loving, happy feel into your home - we can help.<br />
Our team is discrete and respectful of your privacy.</p>

how the place feels. Can you help? </span>

				<p>Yes! Often, the residual energy of previous occupants (I mean live ones) can remain in a location long after the previous occupant has moved out. We can help to remove the residual energies and set up a nice, comfortable vibration in the home for you. </p>
